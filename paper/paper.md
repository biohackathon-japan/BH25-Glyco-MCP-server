# Introduction

As part of the DBCLS BioHackathon 2025, we are here to report on behalf on the Glyco MCP server project team. The aim of this project was to investigate how MCPs (Model Context Protocols) can be applied to facilitate the reserach query process between GlyCosmos and PubChem. By integrating glycan-related data (structures, synthesis genes, glycoproteins, and glycolipids) through extensive SPARQList resources, we aim to of enable natural language access to these datasets.
